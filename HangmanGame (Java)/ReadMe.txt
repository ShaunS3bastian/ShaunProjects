Project Overview

The Hangman Game is a text-based console game written in Java. The player's objective is to guess a randomly selected word within a certain number of incorrect guesses. The game provides feedback to the player about their progress and the number of incorrect guesses remaining.

Game Rules

The game selects a random word from a predefined list.
The player starts with a certain number of incorrect guesses (default: 6).
The player is presented with underscores representing each letter in the word.
The player guesses letters one at a time.
If a guessed letter is correct, it is revealed in the word.
If a guessed letter is incorrect, the player loses one of their incorrect guesses.
The game continues until the player guesses the word correctly or runs out of incorrect guesses.

Prerequisites

To run the Hangman Game, you will need the following:

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.
A Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, or IntelliJ IDEA (optional, but recommended).

How to Run the Game

Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the project directory.
Compile the Java source code using the following command:javac HangmanGame.java
Run the compiled program with the following command:java HangmanGame
Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

Gameplay Instructions

The game will start with a welcome message and display the initial word as underscores, indicating unguessed letters.

You will be prompted to enter a letter. Type a letter and press Enter.

If the letter is correct, it will replace the corresponding underscore(s) in the word.

If the letter is incorrect, the game will decrement your incorrect guesses count.

Continue guessing letters until you either:
Successfully guess the entire word and win the game.
Run out of incorrect guesses and lose the game.

The game will provide a congratulatory message or reveal the word when the game ends.

You can choose to play another round if you wish.


Code Explanation

The code is organized into a Java class named HangmanGame. It uses a simple text-based interface to interact with the player.
It initializes the game by selecting a random word from a predefined list, initializes the player's progress, and sets the number of incorrect guesses allowed.
The main game logic is contained within a while loop, which runs until the player wins or loses.
The Scanner class is used to accept user input.
The code validates user input to ensure it is a single letter and responds accordingly.
The game provides feedback to the player about their progress and the number of incorrect guesses remaining.
